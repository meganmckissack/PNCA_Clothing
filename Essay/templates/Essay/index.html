intro to self representation and queer transhumanism [this will need to be a hook, bring them innn]

Digital space is Queer!!!! YOu cAn feel GOOD with ANGLE S

Self representation takes place in many spaces. Digitally and physically we represent ourselves every day. Performing our own image to others through the small decisions that we make. I am going to use a few terms throughout this essay, and I would like to define them now to avoid any confusion. IRL space is a term referring to the physical world, and URL is a term referring to the digital world. In Real Life, referencing real life, and Uniform Resource Locator, in reference to the links that we use to request information and responses on the internet. I will be using these a lot throughout this essay to draw comparison and contrast between these two modes of representation. 
	The example to be discussed throughout this essay for the ideas mentioned above will be the extremely popular method of self photography, the selfie. Selfies contain so much information that will be useful in dissecting the concepts of self making through IRL and URL space: selfies in mirrors, with a front camera, angles of shots, things represented on the self or in the background, augmented reality filters changing face structures, and so much more. I will be using this example throughout this text as an example, as the intersection between the IRL and the URL space. The selfie is an everyday occurrence and form of documentation and communication. Within this essay I am going to speak on and examine the selfie as an intersection between queer presentation theory and queer transhumanism, and prove that this form of picture taking is a tool that can be used, like many others, to gain representation, safety, adn social capital for oneself.


BODY[10-13 pages]
To start this examination of selfies, why theyre important, and their utility in self-creation, I would like to focus into a particular kind of presentation, queer presentation. Presentation that sits in a deviated space compared to cisgender-heteronormative presentation. My intention with this is to create a true understanding of what digital space can allow for (safety, social capital for underprivileged groups, power in self-conception). I will first need to establish that digital space in its structure is inherently facilitates queer expression to truly examine the effects and possibility of digital self photography.

“If cyber-virtual existence is to be mediated through the screen, its spatiality is hinged on the pixels that depict it, and we have seen that this folding/ unfolding process is most aptly completed by the screen - as the politics of its depiction allow for a (chosen) presentation to exist at the same spatial level as the body that normative politics wishes to pit against it. Then, this second skin of the screen does not only unfold into the corporal body, but is the virtual body that a queer identity can inhabit. Also, this other body is made possible through the gaps and lapses that the cyber-virtual affords in escaping the constraint of normativity, in its openness to multiplicity. It is the cyber-virtual, in its mechanics and as a ‘space', that can allow us to break open the singular body, to allow for the embodiment(s) that one's queerness desires.”	
									-Sebastian Castro Niculescu

In the article Gaps, Lapses, and (Hyper)Links: On Queerness and Virtualiy, Niculescu makes a compelling argument for digital spaces facilitates queer expression. Secret facebook groups allow for expression separated but congruent with IRL presentation. They promote safety, by allowing for multiple kinds of social presentation and interaction to occur without IRL consequences. 
This multiplicity of social presentation in URL space “also allows for a depraved identity: an anonymous one.” this anonymity can work against queerness, stifling it and re-enforcing cisgender-heteronormative culure. Niculescu states that we cannot say this space is entirely queer, or facilitating queerness, but rather that we should be away of the “gaps that make queer ness possible in the imagings of the cyber-virtual.”

For the purpose of this essay, I will be operating from a place of assuming that digital space is structured, at least in some sense, in such a way that it facilitates queer presentation. Later in this essay I will go into how digital space being inherently queer allows space for the self-making that selfies allow, as well as the safety, social capital, and the self-fulfilment that comes with that. 
Social capital and representation play a large role in how digital space is laid out and maintained. Because people in the US are operating under a capitalist system, programs that hold our images and value structures are largely commodified in one way or another. I am making the case that, not only are these spaces inherently queer, but they are also inherently socialist and being altered to fit profit models. Examples of this would include increased accessibility of information and destruction of this notion of private property through file sharing sites like torrent, decentralization/de-governing of currency. And so many others. Essentially technology makes every kind of digital information accessible to everyone who owns a computer. Capitalism does not like this, so corporations find a way around it. Anything that can be commodified will be commodified, including our interactions with one another. Performing certain ways is trained into capitalist culture is trained to be valuable over others. Thus social norms and queer behavior in oposition of this. I wouldn't be surprised if the US state eventually makes either their own standardized cryptocurrency, or endorses one led by a major US corporation like Amazon.

Software developers working with capitalist interest in mind will essentially design software under instruction from management that limits distribution without payment. These developers work in tandem with the state. They create restrictive software, and the state makes downloads of certain content without paying illegal. In theory this protects the artists work, however in practice artists are forced to join massive platforms like spotify that charge users subscription fees, and pay artists a fraction of what their work is worth. Examining this process, of capitalist co-option of existing structures and modifying them to serve profit is crucial to understanding the social dynamics of social norms prevalent today.

CO-OPT
This process is one that essentially takes something that exists and modifies it to fit a profit model, in our case, the internet and social interactions between others IRL and URL. The problem with this commodification process is that this profit model fundamentally shifts the cultural standards for people’s identities, presentations, and how social interactions occur.

Lets take a social example of this process, the transgender pornography industry. In this case, the pre-existing structures are sex work and the internet. Through capitalist alteration (configuring the digital spaces as well as the bodies shown), there becomes a demand for a very specific model of transwoman to mass distribute to cisgender heteronormative cultrue. This feeds on itself, the more that people see this model of transwoman, large breasts, large penis, passing to cis-woman standards, the more that the market for this kind of content grows. In more socialist iterations, such as OnlyFans, there is a lot more variation. However, more popular arenas like PornHub overtake them in popularity. After this co-option occurs and the content is mass distributed, trans people in general start getting fetishized. This mass distribution of transgender archetype fundimentally alters the way that cisgender heteronoirmative culture views transgender women.

How does one say that they are a woman without putting themselves in a box. Existing language forces me to put myself into a box of being “transgender” forcing me to wear an adjective as a badge saying “hey this thing happend in the past and you need to know about it”. I refuse, however, I do have experience in this industry, and I would like to say that I speak from experience.

A physical example of this co-option that doesnt involve only transgender women would be the invention and production of the Juul, or nicotine products in general. Juul exists as an intersection between capitalist co-option of technology through the use of exploitation of workers and consumers through addiction. Its affordable price and sleek design allowed it to flood the market. Juul works to alter social norms in order to self promote, much like the process aforementioned in transgender pornograophy.
3 Intellectual: Spotify, keeping money from artists, npr segment::enter through control over means of distribution 

[write here ]

Social media and the internet have provided a space to exist in a way that isn't painful for lots of people, by allowing them to curate their social presentation. Digital space, as it facilitates non-cis-heteronormative performativity, allows for safety, curation of ones own image, multiplicity of identity, and projection through space. “As Ghost in the Shell implies, life itself arises from complexity.”  Problems arise when overarching economic systems recognize these spaces as potential for profit and act on them.

The internet inherently subverts these structures of profit by allowing for accessible download of media. Under a capitalist system this takes money away from artists, however this would not be a problem given other economic systems ugh I would like to address one thing that is somewhat problematic. These electronics are largely available to queer people through capitalist exploitaiton of workers, underpaying them to increase their profit margin and make them cheaper to buy. Planned obsolescence as well as need for profit make this a tireless process of creation and depletion of resources. True resistance means acknowledging and changing this, abolishing the economic system that continues to make it possible, paying artists, making resources accessible to all.

As a woman who grew up with the internet as an outlet for self expression, reclaiming these digital spaces that are being taken from us is reclaiming, quite literally, pieces of myself. 
Selfie
Julia Eckel defines a selfie as multiple things in Exploring the Selfie. She and her co-authors describe selfies with a loose, encompassing description of an image, digital or analogue, that is curated by oneself, using one's hand/finger to control the shutter. Selfies are self-curated usually digital images taken on a phone or a webcam, where the represented controls the representation, social media hosting these images and modes of sharing oneself plays a part of this definition. I would like to pursue a deeper examination into selfies as they allow for an altered social presentation through the use of angles, filters, augmented reality filters (AR), and physical alterations,  more in line with one’s own identity, or in other words, self-building. Sharing using social media, or not sharing and keeping a digital archive for one’s self also play a large role in selfies functionality.

Selfies allow for the creator to perform a kind of self-making, or self actualization where through digital, and physical methods of expression, one builds their self image in their own head, as well as, in some sense their self-image in the eyes of others. The beautiful thing about this form of expression is the expansive possibilities for building a self. This is done in a number of different ways, both digitally and physically, sometimes intersecting. Here is a short list of examples that I have in mind.

What one does with selfies defines their role in affecting self-building. They don't have any real effect on anything sitting without being looked at. The options for what a person can do with an image of themselves is widespread and expansive; sharing, looking, editing, making things with. Two examples of things that can be done include: keeping them for yourself to go back and look at, and sharing them on social media.

Social Media: 

Sharing images of yourself is a form of communication, specifically with the people who are in your digital circle/sphere of influence. Like lots of different tacit forms of communication under capitalism, social currency and privilege are involved. Privilege is introduced when cultural norms are commodified and standardized, currently in a way that demonizes anyone who isn't white and straight. Selfies are social currency. Images of oneself affect others, especially when shared on social media. Showing others a curated image of yourself, where you have edited the image to your liking, can affect their goals and self ideals, in positive and negative ways. Performing in certain ways either brings you positive or negative reactions, depending on the social group observing. So, why does this matter? Selfies allow for a huge amount of expression, you can conform to specific gender and sexuality norms, deviate from them, do both at the same time even if they contradict. Selfies allow for all these kinds of expression to overlap and coexist, in digital and physical space, memory translated through two dimensional pixel planes in our pockets . Why do pictures function as social capital? Showing off to reclaim space! Privilege through appearance and social clout gives you real world effects that can keep you safer than you might be otherwise. This could also work the other way around, where for example you're performing cisgender roles in an IRL setting, but online you can find self fulfilment and community through digital presentation. Sharing selfies also acts as a log of data, locations stored in metadata saying “I am here” in a specific location at a specific time. This virtual log of locations shows a piece not only of what a person looks like but what they do on a daily basis, where they go and who they see.
Personal Log: 
Not sharing selfies on social media, and using them as a journal or personal log of oneself is another practice that is self serving. By keeping this log, it can function as whatever a person wants. I have over 5000 selfies in my digital log that I haven't shared with anyone. They are just for me to look at how I used to look, and to track personal goals, detailing the progress I have made and the work that I still need to do.
While these pictures do not inherently affect other people in themselves, they affect my self-conception, which prompts me to alter certain aspects of myself that other people see in the small amount of pictures I do share with others, as well as in person.
Sharing and not sharing both have real benefits to one's self conception as well as how others conceive you. Both of these actions have individual, complex effects on each person, but the universal achievement of taking these pictures is that they can offer a coexisting alternative to what one looks like IRL.

State social presentation functions in a very similar way, simultaneously as a supporting role to digital presentation and as a standalone method for gender euphoria

Essay, Drawings, Website

[figure, displaying the tech displaying you]
	I am making drawings as an aspect of  this thesis project. They are derived from the ongoing log of selfies I mentioned earlier. In my phone I have over 4500 selfies, the majority of which I haven't shared with anyone. Part of the definition we talked about earlier is that these images are made for introspective, and self reflective purposes. These images help to build my concept of self. Not only are the drawings a representation of myself, but a representation of the augmentation, digital and physical that I have been using to change my own image. As we spoke about before, clothing, tattoos, hormone therapy, surgery, technology, are all pathways for augmentation and modification. Jens Ruchatz speaks about the image of the image. Selfies where, using a mirror, the camera itself is depicted along with the self. Representation of the representation, that is a part of oneself, always on their person, augmenting who they are and what they look like to their own self and others.

“the inbuilt mirror function of the smartphone’s display is fit to replace the mirror , the prevalence of this variety of the selfie comes as a bit of a surprise. The position in front of the mirror makes even less sense since in most of the pictures, the gaze of the selfie shooters is not even directed at the mirror but at the display of their smartphone . The motivation to opt for this form will in some cases be due to the wish to include the whole body in the frame . Moreover, the resulting laterally reversed picture may agree more easily with the self-image , which is habitually formed to a great extent by the daily look in the mirror . With respect to self-reflexivity , mirror selfies have the surplus value of including"
-Jens Ruchatz
Much as the mirror forms one's day to day self-conception of their own image, the mirror selfie acts as an extension of this, sharing the self conception you see daily with all those around you. It's such an intimate and genuine thing, to share how you see yourself daily with others. Its vulnerability. Its community, and care.

With this project, I used this essay and the drawings of my selfies as a way to build more of my self-conception. I used the augmentation of my image for my own reassurance and peace. This essay lives on a website I created to serve a similar purpose but for other people instead of myself. With selfies, clothing, makeup, there is so much information out there, especially for cis people, that people with differing body types cant find the help they need to find items that help them present in a certain way. People should be able to find what they need without hassle or stress of trying to learn things you dont know you need to learn yet. My intention with the website element is to make this insider knowledge not insider, and open source in a centralized location that requires no digging through multiple clothing websites and subreddits. I have a list of garments that I have found that work well for me, and within the code of my website, I have allowed for users to make accounts and share the knowledge of clothes that fit their body types.

ex p a n d: kept to oneself as a viual log, she mentiones briefly that selfies could be for memory, but i would argue this is a crucial aspect of the definition of selfies. Self Actualization!!

"Selfie practices are contextualized as part of a networked culture, and the issue of identity formation, which seems to be the key question of the book, is accompanied by an analysis of aesthetic practices like the use of filters (25–30) and patterns of facial expression in the history of photographic self-portraiture (38–44)."

"The “Selfie Syndrome,” as Borba calls it, “is all about self-promotion, personal branding, and self-interest at the exclusion of others’ feelings, needs, and concerns.” (xv) News articles claiming to prove a connection between selfie culture and mental illness by referring to supposedly scientific or medical/therapeutic statements have pushed this debate toward supporting a pathologization of selfie culture."




GOLD Jens Ruchatz, tech, representation of self, b l e n d
"Occasionally, the self-reflexivity of the photographic self-portrait does not apply to the self of the photographed photographer alone but may, at the same time, extend to the medium’s “self.” By associating photography and mirrors , some pictures have managed to depict their own production , more precisely: the scene of their exposure. The camera that produces the picture is portrayed along with the photographer. Both are frozen in the moment of pressing the shutter release button. What had remained an idiosyncratic option in analog photography has become common practice with the popularization of the selfie. Taking a selfie means, by definition, picturing the taking of a pictur e. Each selfie may be regarded as a picture that depicts the person, the act, and the situation from which it originated. Selfies permit the study of what people want to look like in a photograph because people are shown in control of the exposure. 32 Selfies lend themselves to various readings of self-reflexivity : They may be viewed as self-reflections of individuals, they can be seen to reflect certain aspects of the medium of photography and its practice, and, finally, these two reflections can be combined and the agent of the selfie scene be understood as composed of human and technological components. 33"
asdress critique of narcissistic self representation 

"The resulting digital image file is laterally correct, though, and corresponds to the one that an external observer—or another photographer—would see. 27 Besides, some selfies continue the tradition of analog photography in the immensely popular subgenre of the mirror selfie. Locations for these pictures are usually those places where mirrors hang on the wall as a reminder to check and groom one’s appearance : bedrooms and entrance halls, but most often domestic bathroom s or public lavatories. Since 

"the camera in the picture, by this means emphasizing the intimate relation of the self and the smartphone . The smartphone camera appears as a ubiquitous companion for which even the privacy of the bathroom is familiar territory. In this space the camera is embedded in the routines of preparing the self for the public space where it is exposed to the gaze of others. 28 The visibility of the camera renders the self-reflexive character of the selfie more obvious. Whereas the use of the selfie as a “recording mirror ” only implies the presence of the camera, with the extended arms indicating its position, the mirror selfie construes reflecting and recording as separate functions that converge only in the selfie scene. 2"
